# New Orleans has a pothole problem

New Orleans has a pothole problem that our government simply cant keep up with.
What is additionally frustrating is the lack of a simple way to document where our city needs some help.

Plothole aims to make it simple for residents to report where there are issues.

## How New Orleans currently does it

Per the city's [website](https://nola.gov/dpw/potholes/), you can call 311 Monday through Friday during work hours
and speak to a representative and tell them where the pothole is.  
You can also go [here](https://nola311.org/) and fill out a 'request form' and describe the location of the pothole.

There are three flaws with reporting in this way:

1. Free-text field forms lack structure and make it difficult if not impossible to aggregate data
2. The city provides no way of reporting multiple potholes at once.
3. There is no signal back to the resident that their concern will be actually noticed.

## How Plothole does it

Plothole makes plotting potholes simple **and** accurate by providing
a detailed map of New Orleans with a draggable marker that pinpoints the exact location of the pothole.
Alongside location data, Plothole can also collect information about the pothole such as:

- approximate size
- approximate depth
- time of first appearance
- current status (filled/not-filled)

Plothole will also allow residents to upload photos of as well as subscribe to potholes around the city.
